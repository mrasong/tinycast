# Palette

The command palette is a borderless floating `NSPanel` hosting SwiftUI; see
[architecture.md](../architecture.md) for window ownership.

## Invariants

- **`PaletteWindowController` solely owns the palette frame.** The hosting view sets
  `sizingOptions = []` so SwiftUI never drives the window size — otherwise the hosting view resizes the
  panel to fit content and the top edge drifts on the compact↔expanded swap. A user drag is the one
  frame change that starts elsewhere, and `windowDidMove` folds it back into the anchor so the
  controller stays the authority.
- **The flat `selection` index must match the visible row order exactly**, including the inline
  calculator card at index 0 when present. Selection is the single source of truth for highlight and
  activation. `Features/PaletteRowIndex.swift` is that mapping and stays **Foundation-only and pure** —
  no SwiftUI, no AppKit — so `palette-selection-test` compiles the shipped type rather than a copy.
  Section headers are not selectable and never consume an index.
- **While a footer menu is open the search field never resigns first responder.** Input is frozen
  instead; resigning shifts the text a point or two.
- **Focus restoration is load-bearing.** Paste targets the recorded `previousApp` and requires the
  Accessibility permission (`Permissions.ensureAccessibility()`).

## Summoning

```
⌥Space (Carbon) → HotKeyCenter → HotKeyManager.perform → AppCore's onTogglePalette closure
                                                              ↓
                                          PaletteCoordinator.togglePalette()
                                                              ↓
                                          PaletteWindowController.show()
                                            · records previousApp (the paste / focus target)
                                            · resolves PasteTarget once per summon
                                            · resolves the screen anchor once per summon
                                            · positions, lays out off-screen, orders front
                                                              ↓
                                                    RootPaletteView.body
```

Everything resolved "once per summon" is resolved there deliberately, not per render. `AppCore` holds
only the closure wiring; the behaviour is `PaletteCoordinator`'s.

## Screens

`PaletteState` (mode / query / selection / `focusToken`) is the bridge between the panel and the app.
Showing the palette calls `prepare(mode:)`, which resets state and bumps `focusToken` (a UUID) so the
SwiftUI search field re-focuses.

Each `PaletteMode` maps to one type conforming to `PaletteScreen`, and the protocol is what keeps the
selection invariant honest: a screen exposes `rows` as its single source of visible order, and the
palette indexes into it. Adding a mode means adding a conformer, not a branch in `RootPaletteView`.

| Mode | Screen | Inner list |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.launcher` | `LauncherScreen` | `LauncherList` |
| `.clipboard` | `ClipboardScreen` | `ClipboardList` + preview |
| `.calculatorHistory` | `CalculatorHistoryScreen` | `CalculatorHistoryList` |
| `.emoji` | `EmojiScreen` | `EmojiGridView` |
| `.fileSearch` | `FileSearchScreen` | `FileSearchList` (see [file-search.md](file-search.md)) |
| `.uninstall` | `UninstallScreen` | `UninstallList` (see [uninstall.md](uninstall.md)) |
| `.quicklinks` | `QuicklinkListScreen` | `QuicklinkList` |
| `.quicklinkArguments` | `QuicklinkArgumentsScreen` | `QuicklinkArgumentsView` (see [quicklinks.md](quicklinks.md#the-argument-prompt)) |
| `.extensionCommand` | `ExtensionCommandScreen` | `ExtensionCommandView` (see [extensions.md](extensions.md)) |

Every mode but `.launcher` is a sub-screen that backs out to the launcher. **Tab cycles launcher ↔
clipboard and nothing else** unless the selected row declares arguments, in which case it walks those
fields first (see below); the rest are reached by a command or a global hotkey, and Uninstall only
from a launcher app's Actions menu, scoped to that app.

The argument screen is the one mode where the search field is not a search field: it _is_ the current
argument's input, so its placeholder names that argument and ↵ submits rather than activating a row.
Its own state lives on `AppCore.quicklinkArguments`, the way `.uninstall`'s target lives on
`UninstallSession`, and leaving the mode cancels the pending open. A bare backspace steps back an
argument before it falls through to the usual exit-to-launcher.

### Inline command arguments

An extension command can declare arguments, and they are typed **in the header, beside the search
field** — not on a screen of their own. That costs the header its one simple rule, so it holds two
invariants:

- The search field sits at **one structural position, always**. It is never moved inside an `if`:
  flipping the branch tears down its text view, which drops first responder mid-navigation. Only
  its *width* changes — it shrinks to the width of the typed text so the argument chips sit right
  after it, as they do in Raycast.
- Argument focus is its own `@FocusState`, `argumentFocused`, keyed by argument name. Moving the
  selection hands focus back to the search field first, because the row that owned those fields is
  about to stop being selected. ↵ on a blank required argument focuses it instead of launching.

The typed values live on `PaletteState.commandArguments`, keyed by
`PaletteState.argumentKey(entryID, name)`, and are cleared with the rest of the screen.

The flat `selection` index is the single source of truth for highlight / activation and **must always
match the visible row order**, including the inline calculator card at index 0 when present (see
[calculator.md](calculator.md)).

## Window placement

`PaletteWindowController` resolves an anchor (left edge + top edge) **once per summon** and reuses it
for every compact↔expanded resize, so only the height changes and the top edge never drifts. The
anchor is dropped on hide, so the next summon re-resolves for wherever the user is then.

All of the arithmetic lives in `PalettePlacement`, which is CoreGraphics-only and takes every screen
fact as a parameter, so `palette-placement-test` drives the shipped rules rather than a copy of them.

### Drag to reposition

**Drag to reposition** (`AppSettings.paletteDraggable`, off by default) is the only thing that moves a
panel already on screen. `WindowDragHandle` claims mouse-down on the top strip and on the header's
margins and inter-item gaps (`RootPaletteView.headerGutter`) — everywhere in the header no control
occupies. The search field is a handle too, but only past its visible text:
`TextTrailingDragHandle` measures the query in `Theme.Typography.searchFieldNSFont` and claims the
hit-test only beyond it, so clicking or dragging the text still edits and selects, matching Spotlight.

AppKit moves the frame without going through the controller, so `windowDidMove` writes the new top-left
back into the anchor — otherwise the next compact↔expanded resize would snap the panel back to the
position it was summoned at. That write is idempotent, since `positionPanel` places the frame at exactly
the anchor and its own `setFrame` round-trips the same values.

**The handle tracks the gesture itself rather than calling `performDrag(with:)`.** That method hands the
drag to the window server and returns immediately, so it can say when a drag *starts* but never when it
ends — the mouse-up arrives long after it has returned. `DragView.mouseDown` instead runs
`trackEvents(matching:timeout:mode:)` over `.leftMouseDragged` / `.leftMouseUp`, moving the window by
the `NSEvent.mouseLocation` delta, which puts the whole gesture inside one call. It brackets that with
`PaletteCoordinator.beginPaletteDrag()` / `endPaletteDrag()`, and the controller holds a `DragSession`
for exactly that span. **Only a move inside a session is a user drag**; without that flag every
programmatic resize would be recorded as one.

### The drop guides

While a drag is in flight, `PaletteDropGuideController` puts a click-through borderless panel over the
display the panel is on, one level under `.floating` so it never covers the panel being dragged. It
draws three dotted lines through the default placement — both panel edges full height, the top edge full
width — which turn `Theme.Colors.dropGuideArmed` once the anchor is within `Theme.Size.paletteSnapDistance`
of home. Releasing while armed snaps the panel there.

The guides wait for the first `windowDidMove` of a session rather than appearing on mouse-down, so a
bare click on a handle never flashes them. Crossing to another display re-points them at that display's
default placement, which is what a snap would then land on.

### Remembering where it was left

A drop that isn't a snap writes the anchor to `AppSettings.palettePosition`, and the next summon reopens
there — across relaunches, since it is a persisted setting. **A remembered position outranks the display
setting below**; `PalettePlacement.restored` drops it only when no display still shows
`Theme.Size.paletteMinimumVisible` of the compact bar, which is what a disconnected screen or a
resolution change leaves behind. Snapping onto the guides clears the stored position, so the guides
double as the way back to default behaviour.

The position is deliberately **not** in a settings backup — it is machine-local geometry, the same
reason the Settings window autosaves its frame instead ([backup.md](backup.md)).

Which display an *unremembered* palette anchors to depends on the **Follow the cursor across displays**
setting (`AppSettings.openOnCursorScreen`, on by default):

- **On** — the screen holding `NSEvent.mouseLocation`, i.e. the display under the pointer.
- **Off** — `NSScreen.main`.

`NSScreen.main` alone can't implement the follow-the-cursor case: it is documented as the _key window's_
screen, and an accessory app driving a non-activating panel has no key window on the display the user is
looking at, so `main` resolves to the menu-bar display regardless of where the pointer is.

The hit test is `NSMouseInRect(mouse, screen.frame, false)`, **not** `CGRect.contains`. A mouse location
is the CoreGraphics cursor position flipped about the primary display's height, so a screen's rows land
in the half-open interval `(minY, maxY]`: the topmost row is exactly `maxY`, which `contains` excludes,
while that same value is the `minY` of the display stacked above. `contains` would therefore hand a
pointer parked at the top of one display to its neighbour. `NSMouseInRect` exists for precisely this.

## The search field is Tinycast's

The search field is **not** a SwiftUI `TextField`. `PaletteSearchField` wraps `PaletteSearchTextView`,
an `NSTextView` the palette owns outright, and that view draws the query *and* the placeholder.

**Why it is not an `NSTextField`.** An `NSTextField` has two things that draw the same string: the
cell draws it unfocused, and the window's shared field editor draws it once focus lands. AppKit sizes
that editor a point taller than the field (measured: a 24pt editor in a 23pt field), and the two paths
round the baseline differently, so the same glyphs sat **one point higher** while focused. The editor
is created lazily and then cached on the window, so the step showed only on the first summon after
launch — and only where the eye could track it, when the outgoing and incoming strings share a leading
word. A SwiftUI `TextField` is the same machinery, and its field editor is force-cast to a private
subclass, so a corrected one cannot be vended.

An `NSTextView` **is** its own editor. There is no second renderer, so there is no step to compensate
for, focused or not. **Do not go back to a `TextField` here**, and do not reintroduce a `prompt:`.

**The placeholder.** `draw(_:)` renders it when `string` is empty, at `textContainerOrigin` plus the
container's `lineFragmentPadding` — the exact origin TextKit gives the first real glyph, so the two
cannot disagree by construction rather than by a tuned constant. It draws under the caret and is not a
hit target, because it is not a view. `PaletteMode.placeholder` is still the one source of the strings.

**IME composition.** Marked text lands in the view's own storage, so `string` stops being empty the
moment composition starts and the placeholder goes with it — no overlap with in-flight pinyin or kana.
`textDidChange` refuses to publish while `hasMarkedText()`, so `PaletteState.query` still changes only
on commit and a half-typed romanisation never reaches a search.

**Vertical centring** is `textContainerInset.height`, recomputed in `layout()` against the view's own
bounds. One number, one owner. The field still fills the header row's height so `topDragStrip` meets it
with no gap.

**`lineFragmentPadding` is `fieldEditorPadding`, not zero.** macOS draws the caret as an
`NSTextInsertionIndicator` layer 2pt wide **centred** on the insertion point, so a text box flush with
its clip view loses the caret's left half at column 0 — it renders 1pt until the first glyph pushes it
clear. AppKit's own `NSTextField` field editor pads by exactly this for the same reason (a bare
`NSTextView` uses 5). **Do not set it to zero to simplify the placeholder origin**: that origin adds
the padding back, which is what keeps the two aligned.

**Keys.** `doCommand(by:)` hands ↑ ↓ ← → ↵ ⇥ and Escape to `RootPaletteView.handleSearchKey` first and
falls through to the caret on `false` — that is what keeps ← and → stepping the emoji grid while they
stay with the caret everywhere else. The matching `onKeyPress` handlers are still on the root view and
share the same methods: they serve the inline argument fields, which are SwiftUI's and hold focus
themselves. `keyDown` records the modifier flags because a selector does not carry the chord that
produced it.

## The panel settles the pointer itself

`PalettePanel.applyCursorPolicy` sets the cursor after every mouse event: the I-beam inside the search
field's frame, the arrow everywhere else. Without it the palette's pointer sticks as an I-beam over the
whole window and flickers along the field's edge — the two AppKit mechanisms that claim a cursor here
disagree, and neither yields.

- SwiftUI's `HostingClipView` claims the **arrow** across the entire window as a *cursor rect*.
- The search text view claims the **I-beam** from its own *tracking area*.

Both fire on the same crossings, so the cursor alternates while the pointer is over the field, and the
last claim simply stays put once it leaves — nothing re-evaluates a cursor rect until the pointer
crosses one, and the arrow rect spans the window, so leaving the field crosses nothing.

One measured detail the policy depends on:

- **The field publishes its own frame.** `RootPaletteView` reports it into `PaletteState.searchFieldFrame`
  via `onGeometryChange`, and the panel does a containment test against that. Hit-testing for the field
  instead does not work: SwiftUI rebuilds it as it re-renders, and a hit test taken mid-rebuild misses
  it and reads as *the pointer left the field*. The frame only moves on layout, so it never lies.
  It arrives top-left-down and is flipped into AppKit's bottom-left-up window space.

The rect used to be outset by 2pt, because AppKit's field editor overhung the field it served. The
owned `NSTextView` is exactly the published frame, so the slack is gone. Do not add it back to paper
over a cursor flicker — a flicker now means the published frame is wrong.

The policy runs after `super.sendEvent`, so it has the last word, and it writes only when the cursor
actually differs. It must stay **symmetric**: an earlier version left the field alone and only forced
the arrow outside it, and AppKit's own alternation over the field came straight back.

## One menu at a time

`RootPaletteView` holds a single `OpenMenu?` rather than a flag per menu, so "at most one is open" is
structural instead of a pair of `onChange` handlers pushing each other closed. Three cases today —
the ⌘K Actions menu (`.bottomTrailing`), the app menu (`.bottomLeading`) and the clipboard type
filter (`.topTrailing`, hung under its header button). `menuContent` resolves the open case to one
`PopoverMenuContent`, which is what lets ↑/↓, plain ↵, Esc and the click-away catcher serve every
menu without knowing which is up. Every open path goes through `open(_:highlighting:)` and states
where the highlight starts: the first row, except the type filter, which opens on the active filter.

## Menu-open input freeze

While a popover menu (⌘K Actions / app menu / clipboard type filter) is open the search field reads as inert but
**never resigns first responder**. Input is frozen instead:

- `RootPaletteView` mirrors the open state into `PaletteState.menuOpen`, whose `didSet` fires
  `onMenuOpenChanged`.
- `PalettePanel.sendEvent` then swallows text-editing keystrokes while `menuOpen` (letting ⌘/⌃ chords
  and menu-nav keys through to the search text view and `onKeyPress`), which is how ⌘. and ⌃X still
  reach their rows.
- The caret is hidden by clearing the focused text view's `insertionPointColor`.

The original reason for never resigning is gone: it was the `NSTextField` cell/field-editor swap
shifting the text a point or two, and the owned `NSTextView` has no swap. The freeze is kept as-is
because it also preserves selection and typing state, but it is now a **candidate for simplification**
rather than a constraint — resigning first responder here is no longer a visual regression.

## Chords `onKeyPress` never sees

Most ⌘/⌃ chords reach SwiftUI's `onKeyPress` fine. Three kinds do not, and all of them are handled in
`PalettePanel.sendEvent` before `super` hands the event to the responder chain:

- **A bare backspace** — the search text view consumes it as an edit (`onBareBackspace`).
- **Chords with no main menu item** — ⌘, and ⌘w, which an app with a menu bar would never see here.
- **Chords AppKit has already bound to a selector.** `⌘.` is the one that bites: AppKit binds it to
  `cancelOperation:` alongside Escape, so `interpretKeyEvents` hands it to the search text view and
  `onKeyPress(keys: ["."])` never fires. Pin (⌘.) therefore arrives through `onCommandShortcut`,
  which bumps `PaletteState.pinChordToken`; `RootPaletteView` observes that and resolves the row
  through the current screen, so **which** row gets pinned still comes from `screen.rows` alone.

Adding a chord that "does nothing" is almost always one of these three — check `sendEvent` before
assuming the handler is wrong.

## Emacs navigation chords

⌃N/⌃P and ⌃F/⌃B navigate exactly as ↓/↑ and →/← do — on the emoji grid all four step the selection,
and everywhere else the horizontal pair falls through to the caret, which is what a native search field
does.

None of them navigate on their own: AppKit's key-binding table hands the search text view
`moveDown:` / `moveUp:` / `moveForward:` / `moveBackward:` first, and in a one-line field the vertical
pair walks the caret to the end or the start rather than moving anything.

`PalettePanel.sendEvent` therefore rewrites each chord into its arrow and re-dispatches, ahead of every
other rule it applies. Nothing else changes: the arrow handlers in `RootPaletteView` are the only
navigation code, so the compact bar's expand-on-↓, the grid's row and column steps, menu highlight
movement and the scroll-into-view intent all follow for free. The caret keeps ⌃F/⌃B off the grid
because `moveHorizontally` declines →/← there, and the text view then moves by a character exactly as
the chord natively would. A chord carrying any modifier beyond ⌃ — ⌃⇧Q, say — is left alone.

## Focus restoration (load-bearing)

`PaletteWindowController` records `previousApp` (the frontmost app) on show. Paste then targets that
app:

- `Paster.paste` activates it and posts a synthetic ⌘V via `CGEvent`.
- `Paster.pasteInPlace` posts ⌘V straight to the app's PID _without_ activating it, so the palette can
  stay open and frontmost (used by "paste keeping window open").

Both require the Accessibility permission (`Permissions.ensureAccessibility()`).

The same show also mirrors that app into `PaletteState.pasteTarget` (a `PasteTarget`: localized
name + bundle path), so Clipboard and Emoji can name it — the footer pill reads "Paste to Notes" and
the ⌘K paste rows carry the app's icon. Resolved once per summon, never per render, and deliberately
not cleared by `prepare` (pop-to-root resets the screen, not the target).
